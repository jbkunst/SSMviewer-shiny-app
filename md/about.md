# About Sustainability Science Viewer
Sustainability Science Viewer is an interactive platform that presents the preliminary results of the project "[Social Networks and Sustainability Science](https://sna-ssla.netlify.app/)" (FONDECYT No. 1220560), funded by the National Research and Development Agency (ANID, Chile) through its Regular FONDECYT program. 

The main objective of this research project is to analyze the generation of scientific knowledge in sustainability science in Latin America over the past 30 years, with a focus on the structure and dynamics of the research network. The project is articulated on three levels: 

- At the macro level, it reconstructs the global research network in sustainability science. 
- At the meso level, it explores the contexts in which knowledge is generated. 
- At the micro level, it identifies and analyzes patterns of collaboration and knowledge production.

This ShinyApp provides a global overview of scientific production in sustainability science, based on open data extracted from [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) and [SciSciNet](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02198-9) using tailored queries to identify relevant publications. Users can explore key indicators such as: 

- Volume and temporal evolution of scientific production;
- Participation of scientific disciplines;
- International collaboration networks;
- Gender distribution among authors;
- Semantic content elements;
- Interdisciplinarity metrics.

The app includes filters by time period, scientific disciplines, and geographical regions, offering a flexible and accessible interface for exploring the field.
This tool is designed for a broad audience interested in science of science and sustainability, including researchers, policymakers, and practitioners. It aims to foster understanding of the development and structure of sustainability science and to support informed decision-making.
